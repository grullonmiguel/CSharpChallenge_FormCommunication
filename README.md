# C# Weekly Challenge - Form Communication
Form Communication - sending data between forms in C#

From the IAmTimCorey YouTube Series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJxXtJIPTtQ

# Goal
Wire up the sample project forms. Identify a way for the MessageCreation form to communicate back to the Dashboard and SubDashboard to display the appropriate message.

# Bonus
Set up the communication in such a way that the MessageCreation form has no knowledge of who called it (directly or indirectly).
